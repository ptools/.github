# PTools

## About Us

Welcome to Ptools! 
We are a team of scientist mostly interested in theoretical chemistry, particularly in large complex formation.
Part of what we do it to provide open-source software, webserver and libraries that help comprehend macromolecular assembly processes.

## Our Projects

Here are some of the projects we are currently working on:

- **PTools**: molecular assembly/folding library in Python - ([repo](https://github.com/ptools/ptools)).

- **Heligeom Webserver**: A webserver for characterizing, manipulating and assembling structural units with a screw organization ([repo](https://github.com/ptools/heligeom_webserver)).

- **PTools legacy**: legacy version of the PTools library written in C++ & Fortran with Python bindings ([repo](https://github.com/ptools/ptools-legacy)).

## Team

- Chantal PRÉVOST, CNRS, Scientific team leader,
- Benoist LAURENT, CNRS, development team leader (PTools library),
- Hubert Santuz, CNRS, development team leader (heligeom webserver),
- Charles ROBERT, CNRS.
